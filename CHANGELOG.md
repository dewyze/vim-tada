## 0.2.0 - 2022-03-04
- Fix colors to support `gui` and `cterm` colors
- Change Box command to `<C-Space>`
  - I forgot about `<C-B>` for scrolling :see_no_evil:
  - Hard to find a `<C->` command that works in both normal and insert mode
  - Toggling backwards seems less important than finding a keymap
